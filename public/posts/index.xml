      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does working a lot on one project make Jack a dull boy? Does it make Jack want to quit his job and buy a sail boat? How is the mighty Claude Shannon involved?&#xA;This type of qwuestion has everything I like, it&amp;rsquo;s got a bottom line impact, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to state, and critically, it&amp;rsquo;s HARD to see a good approach off the rip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do we quantify something like &amp;lsquo;variety&amp;rsquo; of project work? If we&amp;rsquo;re going to understand the relationship between engagement, or expected employment time, or burnout, &lt;em&gt;variety&lt;/em&gt; needs to packaged into a statistic without losing expressiveness.&#xA;Something like mean projects billed, or mean clients billed seems promising at first but ultimately fall flat when considered more deeply&#xA;Consider two junior analysts who worked on 2 client accounts over the year, one is splitting their time 90/10 and the other is splitting time 50/50.&#xA;Both analysts will have the same number of clients and number of projects yet they have very starkly different &lt;em&gt;variety&lt;/em&gt; in their daily work.&#xA;What you need is a statistic that varies with the way that hours are billed that is a statistic that granularly varies is an hour were to move from one client to another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
