I'm going to make some educated guesses about who you are reader: 
- You want to learn more math than you know right now, that's GREAT! 
- You're having a hard time doing it. That's normal. 
- You'd like some strategies to make it less hard. I can understand that.

My name is Zach, I've been a grad student in mathematics and I've been a working professional who uses math everyday and needs math I don't yet know quite often. I've learned a lot of math both in the classroom and as a working professional and have successfully applied these mathematical concepts to real problems in the real world.

Here's what I've learned, I'm passing it on in the hopes that you can learn from my mistakes. 

# The hard truth
There is no way around this, learning math is hard. Self studying math is harder. I've done it both ways, I've been a grad student and I've been a guy working a job who needs some more robust tool sets to accomplish a task. All that being said, there are ways to make it easier on yourself.  They aren't tricks per se, in fact most of what you're about to read sounds like doing it on hard mode BUT you will come out the other side of your reading and figuring actually understanding what's going on. 

Most of you who are reading this are likely here because you found a topic that's interesting in some other area of study (computer science, machine learning, finance, etc.), and you want to understand what's going on under the hood so that you can apply it to some context of your own. You likely read it in a paper from the ArXiv and you then likely went to the ArXiv to find some other papers on this new topic and were immediately swarm tackled  by definitions, notation, and 'obvious' results that didn't seems so obvious. This is a common experience, and it's OK. 

Now that we have the hard truth out in the open let me give you the good news. 

# Good news
If you're reading this article you have won at least half the battle already. You **WANT** to do this. That's really the first trick. It's going to be hard, and like in everything else *difficult pursuits reward desire*. You're going to smash your head against  the door that separates you from understanding over and over until that door breaks down and step one is enjoying hitting your head against the door. Mission accomplished. 

I have good news, mathematicians aren't gods. I know quite a few of them, I've hung out, studied, and drank with many of them and I can confirm that they are squishy humans like the rest of us. *I've seen mathematicians struggle to understand math* just as much as any of us. **YOU CAN LEARN HARD MATH** because they learned hard math and their just as normal as any of us. Are there outlier? sure! But you don't need to be Michael Jordan to play 3v3 with the boys on a Saturday and you **DON'T NEED TO BE GAUSS TO LEARN AND APPLY NEW MATH IN YOUR WORK**.


# Game Plan

## Start from the start
Math is a cumulative pursuit. You need to understand sets, and basic logic and proofs before you start learning topology, or learning advanced linear algebra. You can't jump straight from calculus 1 into sheaf cohomology and expect to be successful. There is a lot of background that you need to build up. Math is a lot like a physical pursuit, if you stand under a 500 bar and try to squat it on you first day in the gym, you will fail and you'll probably hurt yourself. 

The time you spend learning the fundamentals will pay dividend later 100 fold. 

## Start with text books

**Papers** are a way for people with understanding to pass information to others with understanding. The intended audience is other mathematicians with deep understanding of a field in which the author is going to make a contribution that will move their collective task of understanding toward completion. They are not, generally, tools that are intended to bring you, a student, up to speed on the basic definitions, and core fundamentals of a topic. They aren't a great place to start. 

**Textbooks** by contrast *are purpose built for YOU* the learner. They are written with the express intent of bringing the reader up to speed on a topic. Dummit and Foote wrote *Abstract Algebra* to get first year grad students up to snuff on algebra. These are the best, first resources for your entry into a topic. If you give these books the time they deserve, that time will pay dividends when you are ready to attack that paper your trying to understand. 

## Learn how to read math books
You can checkout a [post](how_to_read.md) I made all about this topic to give you a good starting point.

## Check out MIT open courseware
The content of many core mathematics courses are on [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Mathematics). These are top tier courses from top tier professors. The most useful content in these courses are the syllabi, the calendar, and the problem sets.
    **Syllabus**: Contains the book list for the course. If you're ever wondering what book is good for a particular subject, this is a great resource. 
    **Calendar**: You don't need to keep to the calendar, you can go faster or slower as you need, BUT the calendar contains the reading assignments that go with the problem sets, and the ordering of the content, Sometimes parts of books can and should be skipped for the sake of staying on the path to acquiring critical knowledge. The course calendar will tell you this insider info. 
    **Problem Sets**: Math isn't learned by only watching lectures, or reading books, it is learned by doing problems. So *do the problems*. 

## Where to start

Your journey will depend on your goals. If you want to learn about Riemannian geometry to understand General Relativity better then your probably not going to be well served by studying combinatorics for months on end.
That being said, there are some universally useful things that you should learn that will give you a solid foundation you can build on. 

- Mathematical Reasoning and Proof: Proofs and logic are the language of mathematics. Learning the basics here is essential to being successful.
- Functions and Relations: All math uses functions, all math uses relations. Learn about injective, surjective, and bijective functions, learn about equivalence relations, learn about partial and total orders. You can generally pick up a good proofs book and learn about all of this in there. 
- Linear Algebra: Everything is hard until it can be reduced to linear algebra. So it's probably a good idea to learn AS MUCH as possible. Axler is a great place to start and as an added bonus, you can knock out most of the first two bullets with Axler as well. 
- Analysis: If you're serious about math, read Rudin at least once, it's a bit of a right of passage. 
- Probability: if you care about the real world (maybe you don't and that's cool too) you need to know some probability. The universe is stochastic, probability gives us language to reason about it. 
- Combinatorics: If your work or hobbies involve programming, you will benefit from being good at counting stuff. If you like your programs to run fast, you will benefit from knowing a lot of combinatorics. 
- Graph Theory: Graph theory is combinatorics where the objects of study are graphs. I'm thoroughly convinced the real world is often best model using a graph somewhere. 
- Numerical analysis: I wish that I had learned more numerical analysis in school, I'm now doing it the hard way, by myself. The real numbers are a disaster, and the PDEs that describe our world are analytically intractable with current tooling. This is exacerbated when trying to solve models of our world numerically with precision as finite precision floats in memory. Yet, we have high quality numerical methods that make models of the world tractable. Doing this is a super power. 

## Find someone who know the content and is willing to help you out. 
Maybe you have a friend at work who studied the math you're trying to learn. Buy them lunch and ask them questions. 

Reach out to the professors at your local state university and see if they are willing to answer your questions. 

The best option if you can afford it-  FEED A GRAD STUDENT by hiring them as a tutor. I used to charge $50 and hour, If you come with questions, you can cover a lot of ground and they get to put an egg on their ramen every day that week!

# Hard pills time

## Youtube videos are cool, but they don't qualify as learning math.
 Youtube probably isn't helping as much as you think. Most Youtube, at least the engaging videos, are dedicated to giving a general audience an overview of why some esoteric bit of math is cool and interesting. We are striving to be *anything* but the general audience. The broad analogy and simplified concepts are cool, and their fun to watch, and they serve as an amazing entry point, but don't confuse them with *learning math*. Learning math happens by understanding all of the gritty details of the definitions and theorems that explain what objects are and why we care. 
I watch quite a bit of math Youtube, I love it. But I would never claim to understand some math because I watched a video about it. You need to do the work, you need to grok the definitions, you need to understand the proofs of theorems and you need to solve problems and only then, should you say to yourself that you understand. Anything less than that and your kidding yourself.  

## Reading pop articles is also not learning math.
See above, it's the same story.

# Concluding remarks
I'm just a dude on the internet, The above is not gospel. You gotta do what you gotta do. 

You're not being graded so you don't have to force yourself to go at a particular pace. Set a pace that you can sustain and still enjoy your life. 

Enjoy the journey, if you don't enjoy the journey, do something else. This is a labor of love and the love needs to be in the labor. `
