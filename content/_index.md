**Thanks for stopping by**

 I'm Zach. I'm the fatther to 2 little boys, the husband to a loving wife, mediocre doer of many hobbies, and a lucky guy to be a giant nerd for a living.  
I love math, specifically combinatorics, group theory, graph theory. I like programming, I do a quite a bit of development at work though I don't get enough of it not to have a few sideprojects going. 
I'm working on my homelab at the moment which is a fun stretch project for me. I used linux all through school but networking and making servers is new to me and I enjoy it. 

 **Projects**
- [Harness Labs](https://github.com/harnesslabs) :  Working on [ARC-AGI](https://arcprize.org/). 
- [wordGo](https://github.com/zornsLemons/wordGo) : Wordle bot and Analysis Engine in Go (WIP)
- [rustyNumer](https://github.com/zornsLemons/rustyNumer) : Numerical Analysis in Rust (COMING SOON)
- [advantageRoll]() : Answering the question 'should I burn my advantage here? (COMING SOON)

If you find anything interesting here, Linkedin or Twitter are the best ways to get a hold of me.
