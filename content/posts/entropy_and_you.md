Does working a lot on one project make Jack a dull boy? Does it make Jack want to quit his job and buy a sail boat? How is the mighty Claude Shannon involved? 
This type of qwuestion has everything I like, it's got a bottom line impact, it's easy to state, and critically, it's HARD to see a good approach off the rip. 

How do we quantify something like 'variety' of project work? If we're going to understand the relationship between engagement, or expected employment time, or burnout, *variety* needs to packaged into a statistic without losing expressiveness.
Something like mean projects billed, or mean clients billed seems promising at first but ultimately fall flat when considered more deeply 
Consider two junior analysts who worked on 2 client accounts over the year, one is splitting their time 90/10 and the other is splitting time 50/50.
Both analysts will have the same number of clients and number of projects yet they have very starkly different *variety* in their daily work.
What you need is a statistic that varies with the way that hours are billed that is a statistic that granularly varies is an hour were to move from one client to another.

Enter **Information Entropy**, brought to you by Claude Shannon, the father of information theory.


Intuitively (:laugh:)
